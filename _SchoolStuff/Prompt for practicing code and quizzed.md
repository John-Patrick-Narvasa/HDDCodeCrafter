# Code exercise (SCHOOL):
Find (questions, structuring, structured condition, )

Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:

## 1st generation

## Structure
- Topic: 
- Coverage: 
- (Problem Solving): 
- Conditions: Difficulty level, specificity, problem-solving, and edge cases

## Quiz Design
- Number of Items: 15-30
- Test/Quiz Style:
   - Multiple Choices (e.g., odd one out, sentence form choices)
   - Identification
   - Sequencing Events
   - Theory
   - True or False
   - Coding Exercises (ranging difficulties)

## Answer Key
- Provide answer keys at the end of the quiz

## Optional Data Links
- Link Feed Data (if applicable)   

## 2nd generation (iterations)
Weaknesses: *after initial prompt* ()
- Make another but rather focus more on the technical terms given on the files imported from the previous prompt.

- Make another set with N items with unique questions that is STRICTLY not the same as the last outputs you have made from my last prompt/s.


# Sample:
1. Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:

Pseudo programming : (coverage: flowcharts, simulation and expected output (me who makes it) and arithmetics in java, and especially PROBLEM SOLVING regarding the last coverages mentioned with some edge cases) (recursive way, linear way, loop way)


Make a 15-20 items quiz in multiple choice and put the answer key to the last (after all the question items)


Or other way around where I get to code and have the desired result/output (only provide fewer items)

2. Document and Summarize everything about all the pre existing context of the quizzes you have made with an emphasis to the edge cases being considered with simple examples 

along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form

Consider more edge cases


# CODE exercises (PERSONAL):
    
1. Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:


Topic : 
specific coverage: 
difficulty: 




2. Document and Summarize everything about all the pre existing context of the quizzes you have made with an emphasis to the edge cases being considered with simple examples 


along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form


Consider some edge cases within the problems and even some odd patterns 


Make a coding exercise problem or application building using this format:

Problem Title/Task Title

Problem/Task summary

Example input/output 1

Constraints


*Dont tell the answer yet until 20 minutes*


## Expanding projects (CalcApp, AreaShapeCalc, TriviaQuiz, SchoolOrgSys)

Is there any way to expand this into or make a by stating tips _additional features_

5. Make a sample code about __specific item, topic, keyword__ and determine its purpose



5.  make an automated git commenter (cuz i forgot that thing always)


make a seperated java code snippet of each search and sorting algorithms mentioned below (revolving around a one comprehensible real world example application): (make comments what their purpose serves with the theoretical explanation and contextual explanation according to the example)

Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. DFS (Depth First Search)
4. BFS (Breadth First Search)

Sorting Algorithms
1. Insertion Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Bubble Sort
5. Selection Sort
6. Heap Sort
