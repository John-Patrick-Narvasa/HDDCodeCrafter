# 8 Steps to Avoid Brainfarts 

1. **Write the desired output**
    Ensure the knowledge of how the program suppose to work for understanding the ins and outs of the program.

2. **Type All Imports and Initialize**  
   Ensure all necessary libraries and modules are imported at the beginning of your code.

3. **Sketch or Comment the Problem**  
   - Use paper or your IDE to outline the problem.
   - **Variable Assignment Manager**: Create an initial sketch to visualize key variables via ARROW POINTERS (my own way of flowcharting).

4. **Initialize All Variables**  
   - Declare and initialize all variables and sub-variables.
   - Keep your variables organized to avoid clutter.

5. **Sketch or Pseudocode Desired Outputs**  
   - Write down the expected results and how to achieve them.

6. **Comment Main Structure**  
   - Break down your code into sections: 
     - Intro
     - Housekeeping
     - Functionality
     - End task
   - Use methods and classes for further abstraction.

7. **Sketch Key Functionalities**  
   - Identify and outline the critical functionalities for each logic block.

8. **Start Coding**  
    :D (enjoy or jump off a building I guess :D)



# Structuring (the IDE itself ONLY)

- **Make a seperate markdown file** for desired outputs (the standard and own understanding)

- **Initialize All Imports**  
  At the top of your file.

- **Declare Variables and Sub-Variables**  
  Group related variables together for clarity.

- **Pseudocode Logic and Arrangement**  
  Outline your approach, including functions, processes, arrays, loops, etc. Consider data structures and algorithms (DSA) during this phase.

- **Redeclare Variables If Necessary**  
  Ensure variables are properly scoped and defined.

- **Separate DISPLAY and LOGIC Blocks**  
  Keep your display logic distinct from business logic to enhance readability.

- **Main FINAL Desired Display Block**  
  Conclude with a clear display of your results, ensuring itâ€™s coherent and organized.
