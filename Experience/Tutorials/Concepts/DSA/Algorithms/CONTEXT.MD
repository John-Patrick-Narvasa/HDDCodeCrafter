# CONTEXT:

It revolves around the example of the BookstoreInventoryManager.java program

prompts:
make a flowchart for that bookstoreinventorymanager program
make the processes more of a thorough explanation in that flow chart parts
answer:


1. **Start**: Begin the program execution.

2. **Input Book Quantities**:
   - Prompt the user to input the initial book quantities into the system.

3. **Linear Search Process**:
   - Iterate through the unsorted book quantities to find the target book quantity using linear search.
   - Display the index if the book quantity is found.

4. **Decision (Book Found?)**:
   - Check if the book quantity was found using linear search.
   - If the book is found, proceed to the output step.
   - If not found, proceed to the sorting algorithms.

5. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - **Insertion Sort**:
     - Sort the book quantities using the insertion sort algorithm.
   - **Merge Sort**:
     - Recursively split and merge the book weights array for sorting.
   - **Quick Sort**:
     - Divide and conquer approach to sort the book ratings efficiently.
   - **Bubble Sort**:
     - Sort book quantities by comparing adjacent elements.
   - **Selection Sort**:
     - Select the minimum element and swap it with the current element in the book pages array.
   - **Heap Sort**:
     - Create a max heap and sort the book weights accordingly.

6. **Output Sorted Book Quantities**:
   - Display the final sorted book quantities based on the selected sorting algorithm.

7. **End**: Finish the program execution.



1. **Start**:
   - Begin the program execution.

2. **Data Structuring and Variable Declaration**:
   - Declare and initialize data structures and variables:
     - Array of book quantities.
     - Constants for maximum book quantities or other program constraints.
     - Variables for indices, temporary storage, and loop counters.

3. **Input Book Quantities**:
   - Prompt the user to input initial book quantities and store them in the array.

4. **Linear Search Process**:
   - Iterate through the unsorted book quantities to find the target book quantity using linear search.
   - Store the search result in a variable.

5. **Decision (Book Found?)**:
   - Check the search result to determine if the book quantity was found.
   - Proceed based on the search outcome.

6. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Implement various sorting algorithms using the declared data structures and variables:
     - Sort the array of book quantities using selected sorting algorithms.
     - Update the array with the sorted book quantities.

7. **Output Sorted Book Quantities**:
   - Display the final sorted book quantities stored in the array.

8. **End**:
   - Finish the program execution.
